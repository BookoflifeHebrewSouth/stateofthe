State of the Commons: Notes and additional resources
============================

[Number of Creative Commons--licensed works](http://stateof.creativecommons.org/#numberofworks)
----------------------------

We arrived at this estimate using Google's cache (see files below) in conjunction with the statistics for each platform we're aware of that:

1. includes at least one million works under a CC license, CC0, or the Public Domain Mark, and
2. is *not* included in Google's cache.

Those platforms are as follows:

|**Platform name**|**Number of works** (rounded down by millions)|source|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Flickr|307 million|https://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/|
|Wikipedia (all articles in all languages)|111 million|http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias|
|Scribd|50 million|Source at Scribd|
|MusicBrainz|39 million|https://musicbrainz.org/statistics|
|Freebase|39 million|https://developers.google.com/freebase/faq#how_big_is_freebase|
|deviantArt|15 million|https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/35540|
|Geonames|10 million|http://www.geonames.org/about.html|
|YouTube|10 million|Source at YouTube|
